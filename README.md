**MyPortal** is a modern, open-source, cloud-first **School Information Management System (MIS)** designed for real school workflows — not vendor lock-in.

It brings together **staff, students, parents, and administrators** into a single, coherent platform covering attendance, assessments, behaviour, communication, and core school operations.

MyPortal is built to be **transparent, extensible, and self-hostable**, giving schools full control over their data and infrastructure.
